A platform that allows users to keep track of their finances.
The user chooses how long each period of tracking should be - a week, a month etc. At the beginning of each period, the ser inputs the starting funds (be it from a salary or some place else). What is left from the previous period can either go to savings, or can be transferred to current period. The user then chooses what part they want to spend on different categories of purchases - for example food, entertainment etc.

Every purchase made has to be labeled according to the category it s associated with. After each input, the user gets notified of the remaining amount for that category.

At the end of each period, the user is presented with a diagram that puts side by side data based on the initial plan for distribution of the funds, and the actual distribution of the funds.
